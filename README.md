# TechTest

Project is to find Last month's total Active-Users. I've built this full-stack project for my personal experience.

Planned the Database model. [System design]
Built The Relational-Database. [SQL server] [Migrated into SQLite for light weight review]
Created views and implemented ad-hoc query to retrieve the count of users for total active users in every individual month. [Back-end: Python]
Presented the output on the web-page. [Frontend: HTML]



*YOU MUST NEED THE PIP.py to install the dependencies in the Flask*\

C:\>cd FinalFlaskFile

C:\>py -3 -m venv testenv        [Creates Virtual Environment in the directory]

C:\FinalFlaskFile>testenv\scripts\activate		[Activating Virtual Environment]

(testenv) C:\FinalFlaskFile>pip -v				[Make sure, pip.py is been isntalled]

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

(testenv) C:\FinalFlaskFile>pip install flask     

(testenv) C:\FinalFlaskFile>python.exe

>>>import flask

>>>exit()

(testenv) C:\FinalFlaskFile>set FLASK_APP=seed.py
